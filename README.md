# CS 534 - Artificial Intelligence | Assignment-1 | Group-5 | README file

ReadMe file of the submission by Group-5 to Assignment-1 for solving Heavy Queens and 9N/8 Queens problem.

## Heavy Queens Problem

## A-star & Greedy Search

- A-star and Greedy algorithm algorithm were implemented in Python and saved as 'Greedy_and_Astar.py' file. 

- The code provides 2 options for feeding in the starting grid into the code. It can be done by giving it a .csv file by providing the path address when prompted or by selecting the option to generate a random grid and then giving the grid size as input. 

- The code shall give the output in terms of the steps suggested by the A-star and Greedy algorithm. A default address is already fed into the code for the .csv file.

## 9N/8 Queens Problem

## Genetic Algorithm

- The implementation of the Genetic algorithm is saved in file 'Genetic.py'. 

- The code provides 2 options for feeding in the starting grid into the code. It can be done by giving it a .csv file by providing the path address when prompted or by selecting the option to generate a random grid and then giving the grid size as input. 

- The code shall give the output in terms of the steps taken by the Genetic algorithm and also display the cost of the same as defined in the assignment write-up. A default address is already fed into the code for the .csv file.

## Hill Climbing Search

- Hill Climbing algorithm was implemented in Python and saved in 'HillClimbing.py' file. 

- The code provides 2 options for feeding in the starting grid into the code. It can be done by giving it a .csv file by providing the path address when prompted or by selecting the option to generate a random grid and then giving the grid size as input. 

- The code shall give the output in terms of the steps suggested by the algorithm and give the corresponding cost for each iteration for 120 seconds by default. A default address is already fed into the code for the .csv file.
